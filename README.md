# ShashZero
This is an project to create a strong NNUE Network from several given sources 

Thanks to the creators of the following repositories:

https://github.com/amchess/ShashChess - Chess Engine used to generate training data | The name of the project also derived from that name

https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess - Using the cutechess-cli as an environment for training data generation

https://github.com/nodchip/Stockfish/blob/master/script/pgn_to_plain.py - This script is used to transform the games into Stockfish trainer training data

https://github.com/nodchip/Stockfish - Used to train NNUE networks for experimental purposes

https://github.com/glinscott/nnue-pytorch - Maybe used later to train NNUE networks


I will be providing the trained networks of test runs and other networks. As well as tests of their strengh will be given 
Training data won't be provided unless anybody is giving me a good reason to provide it.

In order to play, the experimental network is running on an older Stockfish version.

I hope to be able to generate networks for newest Shashchess versions.

Thanks for reading
